# AI Coding Rules (v2)

## 0) Prime directive
- Prioritize correctness, clarity, maintainability, and reproducibility over cleverness.

## 1) Discuss before changes (approval required)
- Do not implement or refactor anything non-trivial until you:
  1) explain the plan,
  2) list files/functions impacted,
  3) call out risks/tradeoffs,
  4) get explicit approval.
- Small, local fixes (typos, obvious bugfix in the same function) are allowed, but still explain what you changed.

## 2) Preserve behavior by default
- Maintain existing behavior unless an intentional change is explicitly approved.
- When changing behavior is necessary, clearly document:
  - what changes,
  - why it must change,
  - how it’s validated.

## 3) Dependencies are a discussion
- Do not add new libraries without proposing options + tradeoffs.
- Prefer fewer dependencies; justify any new one.
- If a library/version is uncertain, stop and discuss first.
- Use latest stable librarys always check wen add a new lib

## 4) Research, don’t assume
- When API/behavior is uncertain: consult official docs or upstream source.
- If you can’t verify: say so and propose the safest path.

## 5) Type hints and readability
- Add type hints for all public functions and any non-trivial internal functions you modify/create.
- Prefer small functions, clear naming, and predictable structure.
- Add comments/docstrings when intent is not obvious (explain WHY more than WHAT).

## 6) Tests / validation expectations
- For risky changes (parsing, timing, IO, concurrency, data transforms):
  - add/extend tests OR provide a clear validation plan (commands + expected output).
- Prefer preventing regressions over “looks correct”.

## 7) Rewrite/refactor quality rules
- If asked to rewrite/refactor:
  - keep feature parity unless approved otherwise,
  - remove single points of failure where feasible,
  - improve architecture without changing external behavior,
  - prefer incremental refactors over big rewrites unless requested.

## 8) Output requirements
- When producing code changes:
  - summarize what changed and why,
  - note any behavior changes,
