1. **Discuss Before Changes** - No implementations without approval
2. **Libs Discussed As Needed** - Research replacements/alternatives together
3. **Research, Don't Assume** -  consult official docs
4. **Latest Lib Versions** - Use latest stable, discuss issues first
5. **Rewrite for Quality** - Same features, better architecture, no single points of failure
6. Dont read Rust.tar.gz this was a experiment
