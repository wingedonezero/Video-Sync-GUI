"""
This module is a *thin wrapper* around the existing monolith `video_sync_gui.py`.
It simply re-exports functions/objects 1:1 so behavior is identical.
In the next step, we'll *move* the implementations here and update imports in the GUI.

Do NOT edit logic here yetâ€”this is a move-only scaffolding for safe modularization.
