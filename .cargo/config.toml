# Build everything (Rust + Qt UI)
build-all = ["xtask", "build"]

# Quick run - builds and launches the Qt app
run-app = ["xtask", "run"]

# Note: These aliases require the xtask crate (see crates/xtask)
# For now, use `make` from the project root instead:
#   make        - Build everything
#   make run    - Build and run
